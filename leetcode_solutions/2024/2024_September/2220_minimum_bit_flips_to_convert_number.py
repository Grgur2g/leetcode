# Example 1:

# Input: start = 10, goal = 7
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:
# - Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.
# - Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.
# - Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111.
# It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.

# Example 2:

# Input: start = 3, goal = 4
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The binary representation of 3 and 4 are 011 and 100 respectively. We can convert 3 to 4 in 3 steps:
# - Flip the first bit from the right: 011 -> 010.
# - Flip the second bit from the right: 010 -> 000.
# - Flip the third bit from the right: 000 -> 100.
# It can be shown we cannot convert 3 to 4 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.
