# Example 1:

# Input: s = "ABFCACDB"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We can do the following operations:
# - Remove the substring "ABFCACDB", so s = "FCACDB".
# - Remove the substring "FCACDB", so s = "FCAB".
# - Remove the substring "FCAB", so s = "FC".
# So the resulting length of the string is 2.
# It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "ACBBD"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same.
