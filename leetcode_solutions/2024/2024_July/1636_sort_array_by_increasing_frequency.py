class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        from collections import Counter
        candy = Counter(nums)
        nums.sort(key=lambda x: (candy[x], -x))
        return nums
    

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
# Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
# Explanation: '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
# Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
# Explanation: '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.

# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
# Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
