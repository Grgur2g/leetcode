# Example 1:

# Input: s = "aababbab"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You can either:
# Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
# Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.
