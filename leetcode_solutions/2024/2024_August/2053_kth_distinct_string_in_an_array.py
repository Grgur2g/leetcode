# Example 1:

# Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2
# Output: "a"
# Explanation:
# The only distinct strings in arr are "d" and "a".
# "d" appears 1st, so it is the 1st distinct string.
# "a" appears 2nd, so it is the 2nd distinct string.
# Since k == 2, "a" is returned. 

# Example 2:

# Input: arr = ["aaa","aa","a"], k = 1
# Output: "aaa"
# Explanation:
# All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1st string "aaa" is returned.

# Example 3:

# Input: arr = ["a","b","a"], k = 3
# Output: ""
# Explanation:
# The only distinct string is "b". Since there are fewer than 3 distinct strings, we return an empty string "".
