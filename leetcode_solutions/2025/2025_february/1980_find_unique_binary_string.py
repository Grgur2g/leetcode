# Example 1:

# Input: nums = ["01","10"]
# Output: "11"
# Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = ["00","01"]
# Output: "11"
# Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.

# Example 3:

# Input: nums = ["111","011","001"]
# Output: "101"
# Explanation: "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.
